        <p>
          We are a registered charity that has provided free, confidential, impartial and independent advice on a range of issues including benefits, debt, housing, employment and consumer problems for over 35 years.
        </p>
        <p class="collapse" id="intro-read-more"><span class="small">
          Our aims are to improve the quality of life for individuals within our local communities through the provision of a high quality, professional and focused advice and information service at our three advice centres in Huntly, Inverurie and Ellon, and other outreach locations across central and south Aberdeenshire. We also wish to expand our successful, environment friendly, sustainable social enterprise business which comprises two charity shops and a payroll & bookkeeping service which helps to fund our advice centres.

          <h3 id="general">General Advice</h3>
          <p>In addition to giving advice on employment, consumer issues, housing and benefit checks, our advisers can help you complete forms, contact various agencies on your behalf, such as the Council, Job Centre or Social Work Department. We can also draft letters on your behalf or signpost you to other agencies, if required. Whatever your problem, we will deal with it sensitively and in complete confidence. Our advice and information service covers central Aberdeenshire, with offices in Huntly, Inverurie and Ellon as well as an Outreach available in Kemnay.</p>
          <p>We have also been working closely with the <a target="_blank" href="http://aberdeenshirenorth.foodbank.org.uk/">Aberdeenshire North Food Bank</a> to provide help to those in need.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <h3 id="debt">Debt Advice</h3>
          <p>All our debt advisers have successfully completed Certificate of Credit in Money Advice Practice through Staffordshire University, are DAS accredited and have vast experience of dealing with a wide variety of client debt. Our debt advisers cover both central and south Aberdeenshire. The service includes identifying client options, assisting clients achieve their desired outcome, negotiating with landlords and their creditors, arranging appointments with third parties and the completion of bankruptcy and other forms.</p>

          <h3 id="incourt">In-Court Services</h3>
          <p>Our In-Court advisers attend heritable and mortgage repossession calling days in Aberdeen, Banff and Peterhead Sheriff courts for Aberdeenshire residents. We offer advice, assistance and representation to unrepresented defenders who are at risk of eviction, are struggling to pay rent or mortgage payments, are threatened with court hearings about debt or housing, have court papers about debt or eviction, need information on sequestration or bankruptcy, or need help with a small claim. The project provides pre- and post-court advice services to tackle the underlying debt issues, including multiple and serious debt, also referrals to other specialist advice services where appropriate.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <h3 id="welfare">Welfare Rights Services</h3>
          <p>We have a small specialist team of experienced advisers who help clients not only with benefit advice, benefit checks, assistance to complete complex benefit forms and applications but also with welfare benefit appeals including representation at tribunals and tax credit appeals, including sanctions. Home visits are available for physically/mentally disabled and/or elderly clients who are housebound.</p>
          <p>Our clients will receive advice and assistance on all aspects of preparing their case and will also be accompanied by an adviser at their Tribunal hearing. Usually, this will be the same adviser who has been carrying out the casework. This means the case will be well known to the adviser and often helps the client overcome nerves at the thought of attending a hearing. Occasionally, another of our advisers will represent the client – any change will be fully explained.</p>

      <p>Our shops, <i>Bargain Box</i> and <i>Review</i>, sell second-hand goods, including furniture, clothing and bric-a-brac, which are donated by the generous community. We rely on donations of good quality clothing, household goods, furniture and more to help fund our advice centres. The full-time staff members are supported by volunteers who are invaluable in the day-to-day running of the shops.</p>
      <p>We also offer a collection & delivery service for furniture, clothing, bric-a-brac and even house clearances. Any and all donations are an incredible help to both of our shops.</p>
      <p>We also take clothing and fabrics in poor quality to sell for recycling however we regret we cannot take or recycle duvets and pillows.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-6">
            <h4>Advice Centre</h4>
            <p>The role of an adviser is very varied. Some of the things advisers do in the advice centre:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Interview clients at the office, by phone or in person</li>
              <li>Provide information from AdviserNet and other sources</li>
              <li>Offer practical help to clients by writing letters, making phone calls and helping fill in forms</li>
              <li>Perform calculations (for example, to assess entitlement to certain kinds of benefits)</li>
              <li>Refer clients to other agencies if they are better placed to help</li>
              <li>Keep records of all client cases</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                "I joined <abbr title="Gordon Rural Action">GRA</abbr> a few months ago after previously seeking advice from them in a personal matter. I feel they offer a reputable, first-class service, and felt by volunteering I was giving something back to the organization and to the local community. No two days are the same; it is challenging, rewarding and varied."

          <div class="col-sm-6">
            <h4>Charity Shops</h4>
            <p>Some of the things a shop volunteer does is:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Serve customers at the till</li>
              <li>Take customers details for collections or deliveries</li>
              <li>Organize and price incoming stock</li>
              <li>Decorate the shop displays, including the window</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Bargain Box is a retail shop and all goods are contributed from donors. I am amazed at the generosity of the people in North East Scotland. I work once a week in the shop and I have the chance to meet a lot of people because I work different days. Usually I prepare and price the goods before they are put in the front shop and I also operate the till. I feel I have gained confidence when talking with co-volunteers and customers. The ethos of the shop is to raise funds for the charity and to have fun.</p>
